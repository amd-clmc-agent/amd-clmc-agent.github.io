CMake Error at catkin/rt_utils/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):

  By not providing "FindEigen.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has

  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen", but

  CMake did not find one.



  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen" (requested

  version 3.2.4) with any of the following names:



    EigenConfig.cmake

    eigen-config.cmake



  Add the installation prefix of "Eigen" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set

  "Eigen_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Eigen"

  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been

  installed.
